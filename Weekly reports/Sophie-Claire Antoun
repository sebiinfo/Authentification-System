Installation of Cmake and OpenCV (couldn't check if it works yet), installation of libomongoC (MongoDB C Driver), 
and setting up of my mongoDB compass for a new project (had some issues with the compatibility of the cluster with my compass,
since we created the cluster with Mija's new account (I had already used my free cluster), and it was not compatible on my mac.)

All packages were successfully installed, except for one. ( <bsoncxx/builder/stream/document.hpp> ) 
I hope to solve this issue next week, with the help of professors, because I spent hours on it, and couldn't find a solution. 

I also wrote some codes on input and output of password (masking of letters into * when pressed on keyboard, check if it is the same as the password in the data),
but it was based off arrays, containing passwords and not data from mongodb.

The next step, once the C driver is installed, is to link it to the database, and make it compatible with Jasmine's code for the password Class. 
As Mija mentioned, if the c driver is too complicated to install, it is not worth it to lose even more time on this, and we will switch to a local database (SQL Lite  normally), implement our codes and work on the user interface, and switch to mongoDB later depending on convenience and time. 

Once the password is set up, we will then move on to Image encryption and data processing.

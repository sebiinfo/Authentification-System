Santorin Yu:
This week, I did some research on the process we could carry out using Open CV (detection, extraction, recognition).
Unfortunately, I have yet to manage to install this library (on Windows). I also studied the features of some facial algorithms
(notably CNN and eigenface).
Next week, I plan to install Open CV, to discuss  which algorithms would be most suitable for the project and to better understand
biometric models.

This week I did the following:
- I spent some time trying to download OpenCV on Windows, but so far I haven't managed to finalize installing it on my machine. I'll take care of this task the upcoming week in order to start coding and test the library.
- I researched some facial recognition algorithms in order to understand the code and get familiar with some concepts (in particular, I looked into cascade classifiers)
- For the next week, I plan install OpenCV and discuss with my colleagues what algorithms to choose and how to further develop our project.

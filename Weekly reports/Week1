-Installed and compiled OPENCV on my machine, and ran a few examples to get accustomed to the library
-Did research on the design of facial recognition algorithms
-For next week I plan to help my colleagues run OPENCV, develop a clearer view on how the parts of the project come together
and implement a few basic examples of manipulating images and recognizing patterns

Santorin Yu:
This week, I did some research on the process we could carry out using Open CV (detection, extraction, recognition).
Unfortunately, I have yet to manage to install this library (on Windows). I also studied the features of some facial algorithms 
(notably CNN and eigenface). 
Next week, I plan to install Open CV, to discuss  which algorithms would be most suitable for the project and to better understand 
biometric models.

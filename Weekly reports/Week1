Sebastian Simon:

-Installed and compiled OPENCV on my machine, and ran a few examples to get accustomed to the library
-Did research on the design of facial recognition algorithms
-For next week I plan to help my colleagues run OPENCV, develop a clearer view on how the parts of the project come together
and implement a few basic examples of manipulating images and recognizing patterns

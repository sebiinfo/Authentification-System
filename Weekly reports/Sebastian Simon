Sebastian Simon:
Week1:
-Installed and compiled OPENCV on my machine, and ran a few examples to get accustomed to the library
-Did research on the design of facial recognition algorithms
-For next week I plan to help my colleagues run OPENCV, develop a clearer view on how the parts of the project come together
and implement a few basic examples of manipulating images and recognizing patterns

Week2:
-I built the general framework of the project on the main and facial recognition branch, added doc, libs souces, gitignore and cooperated with Budura Bogdan on the \
general CMake files of the project
-managed to run opensource code on opencv to work with camera and run the facial recognition using haarcascades already implemented in git
-started planning the classification algorithms together with Santorin Yu, which will take the vector containing important information and classify it in multiple classes according\
to the specific face of the user
-next week I will implement the data class which stores the vectors and write the first algorithm to separate the nodes into classes

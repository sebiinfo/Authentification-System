Week 1 (21/11/2022 - 27/11/2022):
- This week, I took some time installing openCV, for the moment it still doesn't work so I will try to fix it next week.
- I worked on the password: I created a class Password with different functionalities. The class can : set a password, change it, show the hash, 
create a random password, ... For the moment, it is in the branch: Encryption-Password. 
- The only thing missing is the encryption of the password which I will work on next week. I need to decide on an algorithm to encrypt the password 
and code it. This will probably be done by next week.

Week 2 (28/11/2022 - 4/12/2022):
- This week, I worked on the encryption on the password together with Yassine. We finished it. 
- I also created a function to test the encryption (make sure the hashes are unique). The function is implemented but we haven't tested it yet.
- Next week, I will test the encryption thanks to the test function I created and 
I will work together with Sophie and Mija to link what I did with the database. 
Depending on where Paula and Victor are, I will also work on linking my code with the User Interface.

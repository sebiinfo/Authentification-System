Installed OpenCV and studied a first example of Face Detection. 
Explored options for the facial recognition algorithms especially focusing on the distinction between non-machine learning, regular machine learning and deep learning alternatives.
For the next week I plan to start the development of generic interfaces that are independent of the choice of algorithm and start to specialize in one of the algorithm possibilities.

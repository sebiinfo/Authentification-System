Week #1 (21/11/2022 - 27/11/2022)
- Spent at least 6 hours trying to download OpenCV on Windows which was very complicated because you need to use CMake to connect OpenCV to QT but CMake is programmed
  to connect OpenCV to QT5 but we need to use it with QT6 so I tried to modify the CMake variables and libraries and I managed to get through most of the steps but it
  is still not working. Hopefully, I will finish by next week.
- Did research and took notes on OpenCV modules that will be helpful for our facial recognition project.
- Learned about user interface by looking at the QT libraries for C++ and starting a widget-based desktop application with some basic buttons.
- Created a sketch on my computer of how the app could work. It showed every function needed and how the screen would look with the buttons and paths leading to the 
  other screens. 
- Completed the README file with all of the information needed

For next week
- Finish downloading and installing OpenCV
- Continue developing the desktop application and learn how to make it more aesthetic as well as how to link the pages and how to implement functions
- Start looking at how to make iOS/android applications

# Weekly Project Reports

#### Victor Lasocki

### Week1

**What I did this week:**
> - Spent quite some time trying to get CMake and OpenCV downloaded and running on my computer (still not completely done) 
> - Experimented with building an App and a UI in QT Creator. Created a very basic desktop app with a basic login page and played around with buttons, 
> different pages and functions to see what could be done for our project

**Aim for next week:**
> - Finish setting up OpenCV
> - Using what I have learned we will be able to do in QT, to complete the plan of what we want the final interface to look like made by Paula
> - Look into more complex elements of the UI
> - Research possibilities of expanding the desktop app to a mobile app on iOS and Android devices
